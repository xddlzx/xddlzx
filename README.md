### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at **Gazi University**, graduating in 2026.  
Currently, I'm combining my passion for **research** with hands-on projects in:

- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence** (Federated Learning, Object Detection)
- 🔐 **Computer & Smart Contract Security**
- ⚛️ **Quantum Computing** *(early exploration stage)*
- 🧬 **Low-Level Systems** (Assembly, Microprocessors, Rust)

I'm highly motivated to pursue a **research-based Master's program in Europe** and eventually contribute to cutting-edge research at the intersection of **Security**, **AI**, and **Quantum Computing**.
