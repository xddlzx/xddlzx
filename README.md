### 💼 Who Am I?

I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at **Gazi University**, based in Ankara, Turkey.  
My expertise lies in building secure and scalable systems — particularly at the intersection of:

- 🔐 **Blockchain & Smart Contract Security**
- 🧠 **AI-integrated Secure Systems**
- ⚛️ **Low-level Programming & Performance Optimization**

With a passion for decentralized technologies, I've worked on full-stack dApps, cryptographic protocols, and federated learning platforms secured through blockchain.
